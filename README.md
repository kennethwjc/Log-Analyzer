<h1>🖧 Log Analyzer</h1>
<h2>📝 Description</h2>
In this project, I developed a script to parse auth.log files, focusing on extracting key user activity details. The script captures command usage with timestamps and user details, monitors user authentication changes, and tracks sudo and su command usage. It also alerts on failed sudo attempts and provides essential information on commands attempted. This tool enhances security monitoring by offering clear insights into user actions and system security.
